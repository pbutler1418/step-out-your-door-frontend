# Stepping Out Your Door

## Description
The Stepping Our Your Door app is an Atlas Exotica clone where users can create their own experience journal to add all of the interesting experiences they might wish to share, read about experiences other users have shared, and add experiences to a "bucketlist" so they can keep track of ideas for future adventures. The app uses a React front-end to let the user to navigate through the site, and a Ruby on Rails backend to store user information. The app also successfully implements an authorization process to let users register, sign in, sign out, and then have access to CRUD capabilities when signed in. The Stepping Out Your Door front-end is deployed on Surge and it's backend is deployed on Heroku.

## Outside Technologies Used
In order to create the "Teleporter" component, I embedded an Airpano search engine which allows users to search through a collection of 360Â° photos, and, in essence, teleporting around the world! Source: AirPano.com
